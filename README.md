## Future Plans:
- Browser Resizability: Currently the game only functions in a single canvas size option. In a future version I plan on continually checking the size of the browser and adjusting the game window accordingly
- Collision Detection and Moving Between Rooms: At the moment the collision detection, and quick movement between rooms is functional, but could be more immersive. Future versions of Maze Game will fix this issue.
